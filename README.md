In this project, we build a chatbot for ‘Foodie’ . The following is done in the project:

NLU training: Used rasa-nlu-trainer to create more training examples for entities and intents. Used regex features and synonyms for extracting entities.

Build actions for the bot. Read through the Zomato API documentation to extract the features such as the average price for two people and restaurant’s user rating. 
Also built an ‘action’ for sending emails from Python.

Creating more stories: Used train_online.py file to create more stories.
